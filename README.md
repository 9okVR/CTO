   | `REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` | Interval between market data refreshes (milliseconds) | `60000` |
   | `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | Optional key for CoinGecko paid plans | _blank_ |

3. In Vercel Dashboard:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add the same variables for Production, Preview, and Development scopes as needed

#### Monitoring Your Deployment

After deployment:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Review deployment logs in Vercel Dashboard
2. **Test Preview URL**: Vercel provides a preview URL for every deployment
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use Vercel Speed Insights to track performance
4. **Track Usage**: Use Vercel Analytics to monitor visitor behavior
5. **Set up Alerts**: Configure notifications for deployment failures

#### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **API Rate Limiting**: CoinGecko free tier has rate limits. Consider upgrading if needed.

- **Loading Errors**: Check network tab for failed API requests.
